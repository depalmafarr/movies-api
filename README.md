## Getting Started

For can be made and grunt served onto your server from the link to the project here (https://github.com/depalmafarr/project2-movies-api)

### Future fixes/issues

- Favorites list will be added at a later date through join table
- List search (hopeful addition)
- possible join table so movies only have to be uploaded once, then any user can say they have watched the movie and rate it on their account.
- Favorite movies list addition.
